<span style="font-weight: 400;">The essential fact that holds the key to unlocking the riddle of our genuine identity is DNA analysis. Our incredible DNA strands weave together the remarkable tapestry of life. DNA testing has developed into a powerful tool that enables people to make life-changing decisions about everything from the intricacies of our general wellbeing to the complex ancestry of our forefathers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the identity of the unborn child's real father could prove advantageous for both expectant parents. </span><a href="https://www.choicedna.com/our-testing-services/noninvasive-prenatal-dna-testing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-invasive prenatal paternity test</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can reduce anxiety and promote parent-child connection. On the other hand, a lot of individuals are interested in the alternatives and the earliest possible time to perform a genetic test on an unborn child or during pregnancy. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The locations for prenatal paternity testing, test accuracy, and the earliest opportunity to verify paternity before delivery will all be covered in this article. Continue reading for a detailed description of DNA testing during pregnancy. It makes no difference if you want to find out who is fathering the child as soon as possible or if you have questions about the process and schedule.</span>

<strong>Understanding paternity testing</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One important and sensitive DNA test that a person can do is a paternity test. But occasionally, it becomes essential. There are several justifications for doing a paternity test. At times of divorce or separation, a court might order a paternity test due to reasons like visitorship grant, guardianship, inheritance claims, etc. On the other hand, a person may occasionally be suspicious that the child does not belong to him or simply be inquisitive about them. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For whatever reason, this is a very thorough and accurate test. CVS and amniocentesis are invasive prenatal paternity tests that can be performed at different times during pregnancy. CVS is performed as early as 10 to 13 weeks of pregnancy. Whereas amniocentesis is available to be performed in 15 to 20 weeks of pregnancy. </span>

<strong>Types of prenatal paternity tests:</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is necessary to know the different options available for you to establish paternity as soon as possible during pregnancy to clear doubts and suspicions from your mind. This way, it is easier to focus on raising the baby properly without any stress or uncertainities. Prenatal paternity tests include the following tests and procedures:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Chorionic Villus Sampling</strong></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A prenatal test called chorionic villus sampling (CVS) examines placental cells, which are the same as fetus cells, to determine whether they contain any chromosomal abnormalities, such Down syndrome. A woman can have the test between weeks 10 and 13 of her pregnancy. It is not a screening test; rather, it is a diagnostic test. This implies that it can determine with certainty whether a child will be born with a certain genetic abnormality.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Amniocentesis</strong></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Amniocentesis is a prenatal technique that examines the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus to check for any genetic abnormalities or issues. Furthermore, amniocentesis provides DNA for prenatal paternity testing. The baby's DNA obtained during amniocentesis is compared with that of the potential father using extracted DNA. The results show 99% accuracy in determining paternity.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>NIPP testing</strong></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">NIPP testing allows you to take a paternity test without any complications for you or your baby. Expectant moms send a straightforward blood sample obtained by their doctor for analysis utilizing their techniques without running the risk of being terminated.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout pregnancy, the unborn child's DNA is mixed and circulated with the mother's bloodstream. To establish paternity at an early stage, strands of fetal DNA must be extracted from the massive volume of maternal DNA and examined separately.</span>

<strong>Duration of a DNA test result?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The length of time DNA testing takes will depend on the case's complexity and the kind of service you need. The procedure aims to give you the results of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNA test</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as soon as it is practical. After the samples are received, you can usually expect to receive your results from our laboratory in three to five business days.</span>

<strong>Summary</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Early paternity testing during pregnancy may aid pregnant parents in preparing both practically and psychologically. Unproven and untrustworthy methods can be used at home or by non-medical professionals to determine the father of a developing child. Reputable DNA testing services such as </span><a href="https://www.choicedna.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choice DNA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer accessible choices for accurate and definitive results in prenatal DNA testing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When testing occurs in the first half of the second trimester, security, accuracy, and timely scheduling are best combined. While selecting the type and timing of prenatal paternity testing is a personal decision, seeking medical advice is recommended. If testing is done as soon as practical, it is imperative to comprehend the risks and limitations. Despite several obstacles, prenatal paternity testing provides expectant parents with the knowledge and assurance they require regarding the baby's genetic father.</span>
